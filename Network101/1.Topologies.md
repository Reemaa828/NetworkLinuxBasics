![Pasted image 20240706185022](https://github.com/Reemaa828/NetworkLinuxBasics/assets/112731236/7badd95f-96c8-43d7-bc6d-7111edf7ad27)

**Bus Topology Overview:**
- All devices are connected to a single main cable, like beads on a string.
- Terminators are required at both ends of the cable to absorb signal and prevent reflection (bouncing back).
- Best suited for small networks due to limitations in performance and scalability.
- Data transmission follows a "take turns" approach to avoid collisions.

**Pros** 👍
1. **Easy to Install**: simpler to set up and require much less cabling.
2. **Flexible**: you can connect/disconnect devices without disrupting the network.
3. **Cost-Effective**: requires less cabling.
   
**Cons** 👎
1. **Less Security**: when a device transmits data over the channel all devices has received and seen this data.
2. **Bad performance when number of devices increase**.
3. **Low Fault Tolerance**: if the cable is damaged, the entire network will be down.
# Star Topology ⭐

**Star Topology Overview:**
- Most commonly used network layout.
- Each device has its own dedicated connection to a central device, typically a switch or router.

**Pros** 👍
1. **Flexibility**: you can add/remove devices without affecting the network.
2. **if one device is damaged, the network is not effected**.
   
**Cons** 👎
1. **Single point of failure**: if central device is damaged the entire network will be down.

# Mesh Topology 👥👥👥

**Mesh Topology Overview:**
- Most fault tolerant network layout cause it has multiple connections if one of links fail the data is automatically routed to another path.
- Every node is connected directly to every other node.

**Pros** 👍
1.  **Flexibility**: Devices can be added/removed without disruption of network. 
2.  **Less traffic**: each device can send/receive directly to another device.
3. **Security**

**Cons** 👎
1. **Complex to install**: Since each device requires a direct connection to every other device, the number of connections and cabling can become extensive, especially as the network grows in size.
2. **Costly**: Increase number of cabling.
3. **Difficult maintenance and troubleshooting**:  Managing and maintaining a mesh network can be challenging due to its complex infrastructure. Identifying and resolving issues such as link failures, connectivity problems, or routing errors can require specialized knowledge and troubleshooting tools.

# Ring Topology 💍

**Ring Topology Overview:**
- The devices connected forms a circular data path. the data flows in one direction only either clockwise/anti-clockwise.

**Pros** 👍
1. **No Data Collision**: the data flows in one direction only, preventing data collision to happen.
2. **Performance is not affected by adding more nodes**.

**Cons** 👎
1. **Slower transmission**: if the source is far from destination, the data has to go through the other nodes to reach destination. 
2. **Low fault tolerance**: if any node or cable in the ring is broken, the entire network is affected.
3. **Highly dependent**: If a device in the ring is added or moved, or if its configuration changes, it can break the network
