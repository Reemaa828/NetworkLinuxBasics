# TCP/IP Model

# What's TCP/IP Model❓
The TCP/IP model is like a set of instructions that ensure your package gets there safely and efficiently.

# 4 Layers of TCP/IP Model ℹ️

| Layer                 | Description                                | Function                                                     | Examples of Protocols                                             | Devices Involved                                  | Protocol Data Unit |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Application Layer     | Topmost layer                              | Provides network services to applications                    | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS, SSH                                  | User applications (browsers, email clients, etc.) | Data               |
| Transport Layer       | Manages data transfer between applications | Ensures reliable or connectionless data delivery             | TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol) | -                                                 | Segments           |
| Internet Layer        | Handles routing and addressing             | Moves data packets across networks                           | IP (Internet Protocol)                                            | Routers                                           | Packets            |
| Network Access Layer  | Lowest layer                               | Transmits and receives data frames over the physical network | Ethernet, Wi-Fi                                                   | Switches, network interface cards (NICs)          | Frames             |
## 1️⃣Network Access Layer

- The Link Layer is the lowest layer of the TCP/IP model and is responsible for the physical transmission of data between nodes on the same network. It deals with hardware addressing, error detection, and the reliable transmission of frames (data packets) within a local network segment.
- This layer has different implementations depending on the type of physical network being used, such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi
- At this layer, the IP packet is encapsulated in a data frame with a specific hardware address, known as the MAC address, of the receiving device on the local network.
## 2️⃣ Internet Layer

- The Internet Layer is responsible for addressing, routing, and forwarding data packets between different networks. It ensures that data packets reach their destination across the internet or any interconnected network.
- The primary protocol used at this layer is the Internet Protocol (IP). It assigns a unique IP address to each device connected to the network, allowing routers to direct data packets to the correct destination based on these addresses.
- When data segments or datagrams arrive from the Transport Layer, the Internet Layer adds the source and destination IP addresses, forming an IP packet.
## 3️⃣ Transport Layer

- The Transport Layer is responsible for end-to-end communication between devices on the network. It ensures reliable and orderly data delivery, error detection, and flow control.
- The two most commonly used protocols at this layer are:
    - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): It provides reliable, connection-oriented communication. TCP ensures that data packets are delivered without errors and in the correct order. It also handles flow control to prevent overwhelming the receiving device with too much data at once.
    - UDP (User Datagram Protocol): It is a simpler, connectionless protocol that offers minimal error checking and no guaranteed delivery. UDP is used for applications where speed is more critical than reliability, such as real-time video streaming or online gaming.
- When data is passed down from the Application Layer, it is divided into smaller chunks called segments (TCP) or datagrams (UDP) for transmission over the network.
## 4️⃣ Application Layer

- The Application Layer is the top layer of the TCP/IP model, and it is responsible for providing network services directly to user applications. These services allow software applications to communicate over the network. Examples of applications that operate at this layer include web browsers, email clients, and file transfer programs.
- Some common protocols at this layer are HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for web browsing, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for email, and FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for file transfers.
- This layer is where user data is generated or consumed, and it formats the data in a way that is understandable by the application.
