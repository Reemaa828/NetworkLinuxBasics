# Network Types Depends on two things

## 1. Geographical Area üåç
### - Local Area Network (LAN)
Computing Devices within the network are connected in a limited restricted area such as schools, hospitals, buildings or university campus.
**LAN Types:**
- Wired LAN: by ethernet.
- Wireless LAN: by WI-FI.

### - Wide Area Network (WAN) 
Computing Devices within the network are connected in a large area such as between continents, over seas. the internet is a good example of WAN.
Largest type of network may include MAN,PAN and LANs within it.

### - Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) 
Computing Devices within the network are connected across a city or town.

### - Personal Area Network (PAN) 
Computing Devices is connected on a personal level by either Bluetooth, USB, NFC or RF signal.

## 2. Host Roles üë•

### - Client/Server Network
- Every device either acts as  a client or a server in a network.
- it should have a server in the network.
1. Client: is the one that request data from server
2. Server: is the one that provides data/service to the client

### -  Peer to Peer Network
- Every device can switch between being either a client or server.
- No centralized control.
- All devices have equal responsibilities.
