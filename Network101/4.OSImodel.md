# Open System Interconnection model (OSI)  



# What's an OSI Model‚ùì
Open System Interconnection model: is a theoretical model made so different computing devices can communicate with each other efficiently made by the ISO.
It's also:
- **Universal Language:** Breaks down network communication into 7 layers, ensuring all devices speak the same networking language
- **Troubleshooting Tool:** Helps isolate the source of network problems by pinpointing the specific layer where the issue occurs.

# 7 Layers of OSI Model ‚ÑπÔ∏è

| Layer | OSI model layer    | Protocols                                                                         | Devices             | Protocol data unit |
| ----- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| 1     | Application Layer  | HTTPS, HTTP, SMTP, FTP                                                            | -                   | Data               |
| 2     | Presentation Layer | TLS(SSL)                                                                          | -                   | Data               |
| 3     | Session Layer      | -                                                                                 | -                   | Data               |
| 4     | Transport Layer    | TCP (connection oriented), UDP (connectionless oriented)                          | -                   | Segments           |
| 5     | Network Layer      | IP                                                                                | Hub, Switch, Router | Packets            |
| 6     | Data Link Layer    | MAC                                                                               | -                   | Frame              |
| 7     | Physical Layer     | Electrical signal (copper wire), Light signal (optical fibre), Radio signal (air) | Ethernet, WAP, NIC, | Bits               |

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Application Layer

Application Layer doesn't mean the programs or network applications but it means the Protocols that make these network applications work on the network correctly.
the network applications depends on application layer protocols to function.
so application layer provides network services for network application with the help of protocols to perform user activities.
**Protocols used:**

- HTTPS/HTTP : web surfing.
- FTP: downloading files.
- SMTP: emails.
- Telnet: virtual terminals.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Presentation Layer
<img src="https://github.com/Reemaa828/NetworkLinuxBasics/assets/112731236/2682a7c7-79f6-488a-959c-fdadabea7e04" width="1000">

It performs mainly data translation, encryption & decryption, and compression in the network. On the sender‚Äôs side, it receives the data from the applying layer and performs data encryption and compression to it. At the receiver‚Äôs end, it receives the data from the transport layer and performs data translation, decryption, and uncompresses data.

**Protocols used:**

- SSL: secure socket layer for encryption and decryption.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Session Layer

- The session Layer is responsible for opening and closing communication between two devices, the session layer ensures that session is opened long enough until all data is being transferred. 

- The session layer also performs authentication and authorization for establishing a safe connection in the network.

- The session layer can also sets checkpoints when data is being transferred; the session sees the data; if the data got interrupted the device can resume from the last checkpoint and will not start from scratch.

The main tasks of session layer:
- session management
- authentication
- authorization
- download files in data packets

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Transport Layer

The transport layer is responsible for:
- **Segmentation:** Breaks data into segments, adds port numbers for application identification and sequence number (useful when reassembling).
- **Flow Control:** regulating the data transmission rate. It prevents overwhelming the receiver with a data deluge by dynamically adjusting the flow of segments based on network conditions and the receiver's capacity.
- **Error Control:** Uses checksums to detect errors and request retransmission of corrupt segments.

the transport layer have two services:
1. **Connection-oriented transmission**: based on TCP protocol where transmitting the data correctly is crucial. waits for feedback.
2. **Connectionless-oriented transmission**: based on UDP protocol where the speed of receiving/transmitting the data is crucial. doesn't wait for feedback.


## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Network Layer

The Network Layer facilitate the data transfer between two different networks.
The Network Layer is responsible for:
1. **Logical Addressing**: adds IP addresses of sender and receiver to the data segment forming a data packet.
2. **Routing**: method to rout the data from source to destination.
3. **Path determination**: Chooses the shortest path to transmit/receive the data packets.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Data Link Layer

- The Data Link Layer performs physical addressing by adding MAC addresses to data packet forming a frame.
- The¬†Data Link Layer¬†is embedded as software in the NIC which supplies a means for data transfer from one computer to another via a media.
- the Data Link Layer of the¬†**OSI network model**¬†facilitates the transmission of data only in the same network.
- the Data Link Layer is also responsible for flow control and error control on the media.
- The Data Link Layer, specifically through the Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer, is responsible for regulating how devices share the physical network media (like cables or Wi-Fi) to avoid collisions during data transmission. by CSMA technology (It essentially dictates how devices take turns transmitting data on the shared medium).

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Physical Layer
<img src="https://github.com/Reemaa828/NetworkLinuxBasics/assets/112731236/776a9dee-0dd3-4454-a66c-cdc724084d6d" width="1000">

the¬†**Physical layer**¬†can get the info from the upper layer and convert it into bitstreams(0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs), and send it through a physical channel.
Converts bits to signals.
